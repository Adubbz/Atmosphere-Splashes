# Contrbuting

Submissions should be named following the format `Author_VariantNum.png`. For example, my first variant would be Adubbz_0.png, and my second would be Adubbz_1.png. 

In-progress splashes should be placed into the `in_progress` folder following the above naming conventions, and added to its specific README found [here](https://github.com/Adubbz/Atmosphere-Splashes/tree/master/in_progress/Readme.md).

Finalised splashes should be placed into the `final` folder following the above naming conventions, and should be added to the main README (this file).

Files other than this png should be placed into folders inside the `in_progress` or `final` directories named with your username. For example, if I have some `xcf` files for my in-progress submission, they should be placed into `in_progress/Adubbz/somefilenamehere.xcf`.
