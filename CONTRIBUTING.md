# Contributing

### Naming & File Placement
* Submissions should be named following the format `Author_VariantNum.png`. For example, my first variant would be `Adubbz_0.png`, and my second would be `Adubbz_1.png`. 
* Files other than this png should be placed within sub-folders inside the `in_progress`, `final` or `non_running` directories named with your username. For example, if I have some `xcf` files for my in-progress submission, they should be placed into `in_progress/Adubbz/somefilenamehere.xcf`.

### Submissions
* In-progress submissions should be placed into the `in_progress` folder following the above naming conventions, and added to its specific README found [here](https://github.com/Adubbz/Atmosphere-Splashes/tree/master/in_progress/Readme.md).
* Finalised submissions should be placed into the `final` folder following the above naming conventions, and should be added to the main README (this file).
* When putting your work into the correct README, please ensure your name is in alphabetical order with the others

### Non-Running Submissions
* If you do not wish for your splash to potentially be selected as Atmosph√®re's default, you may place your work into the `non-running` folder, and add it to its specific README found [here](https://github.com/Adubbz/Atmosphere-Splashes/tree/master/non_running/Readme.md).
